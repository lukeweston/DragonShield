DragonShield v1.0

Dragino daughterboard with SPI real-time clock, socket for XBee 802.15.4 module or similar "Bee" module and micro-SD card socket.

The XBee module is simply connected to the serial UART on the AR2317.

The RTC and the micro-SD card are connected to the AR2317's GPIO pins, and an appropriate SPI interface can be implemented through an appropriate driver within the OS.

More documentation to be written in future.
